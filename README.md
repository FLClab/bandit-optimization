# Bandit Optimization

The bandit optimization package implements the algorithms, models and objectives that are used for the optimization of microscopy images. 

The algorithms provided within this repository are used the optimization of STED microscopy. The repository of STED microscopy optimization is available [here](https://github.com/FLClab/optim-sted).

## Installation 

You can install `banditopt` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

```bash
pip install bandit-optimization
```

*Note. When importing the module, bandit will raise a warning about not being able to load the microscope interface. This warning can be ignored.*
